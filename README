There were no additional changes made to this program besides the program
specifications. In this program, the main method is contained in the file
digraph_analyzer.cpp, and this main function calls functions that are declared
and defined in digraph_functions.h and digraph_functions.cpp.

The function stringStream_to_vector serves to take contents of a stringstream
and put them into a vector. This function was useful when storing the inputted
digraphs. The function formattedString formats a string by converting it to
lowercase and removing punctutation; this was helpful in keeping consistency in
how strings are modified throughout the program. The function isNumber checks 
if a string is a number, and this was helpful when taking in the user queries.
Lastly, several print functions were created. printMap prints the contents of the
map to the console depending on the order given. printDigraphWords is an overloaded
function that prints the words coresponding to a specific digraph, and printDigraphWordsWithSize
is essentially the same function but it prints the size at the front.

I thought it was clever how I overloaded the function printDigraphWords so it could
take both iterators and reverse iterators as input. I also thought the use of references
was useful, as it allowed me to directly modify containers.

I was able to complete all the program requirements to my knowledge.
